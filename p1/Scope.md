# Scope

Our team has unanimously decided on the following learning goals.

1. Develop a thorough testing infrastructure, complete with extensive automated unit tests and integration tests. This will also include properly setting up the CI/CD pipeline to run automated builds and tests. We wish to employ test-driven development and build a rigorous test suite for both the frontend and backend.

1. Build a sophisticated user interface that is both straightforward and intuitive to navigate and use, as well as highly visually appealing. Originally, we wanted to learn and incorporate state management libraries such as Redux, but due to time constraints and the learning curve involved, we decided to omit this from this project.

1. Build an effective REST API that is well-designed and efficient. We wish to thoughtfully design the data models used to organize and store information in the backend, as well as develop coherent view models that will be returned to clients.

Ultimately, we aim to build a fully functional and well-integrated frontend and backend. For this reason, we anticipate that it might be difficult to implement all the use cases. We are focused on achieving at the minimum the functionalities required by the Form Manager, and the Form Filler users, providing both the UI as well as the necessary API routes required by the SDCTools. At the moment, we are omitting the Form Viewer use cases.
