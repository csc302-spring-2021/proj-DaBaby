# Collaborate

## About the Team

Our team consists of members with a range of skill sets.Each member offers different strengths. Combined, our team has experience with backend development with Django and Django REST framework, SQL databases, React, UI/UX design, creating Open API documents, setting up CI/CD using Github Actions and Amazon AWS. Our team is also familiar with working in building software development projects from the ground up. As a group, we are flexible when it comes to scheduling meetings, and learning new things and picking up new skills.

As a whole, one weakness that we have identified is our lack of experience with creating thorough unit and integration test suites, designing effective and meaningful test cases, as well as properly creating test automation. Hence, this is one of the major that we have established for this project. We also have limited experience with effective sprint planning and practices. This is something we also hope to work on.

## Task Division

We have divided the team into frontend and backend based on individual team membersâ€™ strengths and interests. We also have a designated individual working in CI/CD, and another working primarily on TDD. With the two teams on each end, members divide responsibilities based on features. For the frontend team, since there are two web apps, one for Form Manager and one for Form Filler, separate members have been designated to each. We work collaboratively on design decisions regarding the API design and the design of data model structure. Additionally, at the beginning, the frontend team worked to design the UI and prototype using Figma.

## Meetings

- When: Tuesdays @ 7pm (standup meeting) & Sundays @ 3pm (weekly syncs)
- Where: Discord
- Meeting minutes will be captured using Google Doc
- TODO tasks will be recorded on Github projects by opening issues and adding to the Kanban board (refer to screenshot)

## Workflow & Task Management

Our flow for collaboration is our team will meet every Tuesday at 7 pm on discord. At this time we will discuss the necessary next steps and record our meeting minutes on a Google Doc, and action items will be recorded onto Github projects, using the Kanban board. On Sundays, we may or may not have meetings depending on if we need them, and the recording of meeting minutes and action items is the same. Throughout the week we will use pull requests to review each other's code to prevent any potential conflicts. If extra meetings are needed we can easily schedule these throughout the week as online school makes for a more flexible schedule for everyone.
